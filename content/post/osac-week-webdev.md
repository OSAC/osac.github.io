OSAC successfully conducted a 5-day-long Frontend Development Bootcamp featuring Senior Software Engineer Sushant Suwal.  
Our speaker, Sushant Suwal, mentored participants in the Bootcamp for 4 days, following a structured roadmap. He provided insights into the field of frontend development and guided participants on how to kickstart their careers in frontend. Throughout the 5-day bootcamp, he taught HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TailwindCSS. The workshop also included a project creation session on the 4th day. To conclude the bootcamp, our talented executive, Anupama Rai, presented a session on GitHub 101, covering everything participants needed to know to get started with GitHub. Meanwhile, the entire bootcamp was hosted by our skilled Bikalpa Pandey, who orchestrated the program exceptionally well.
 
We thank all participants for their enthusiasm and look forward to the next events in our OSAC Week Sessions .

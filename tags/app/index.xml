We successfully conducted &amp;ldquo;Getting started with App development based on OpenStreetMap&amp;rdquo;. The event was fruitful thanks to the combined effort of OSAC team, our dear mentor Ichchha Moktan and all of the participants.
Ms Ichchha guided us participants how to harness OSM in apps, what specific benefits it provides and answered our queries about specific caveats and usecases. About 40 Participants both from BIT and CSIT were present the event.</description></item></channel></rss>

This event marked the beginning of our initiative to host monthly 2-5 day bootcamps, workshops, or webinars on specific tech topics.
The bootcamp covered both theoretical aspects of designing and practical applications. Our talented speaker, Nikki Arts (@nikki_arts__), led an engaging hands-on session, while Anupama Rai (@anupamaa_raii) skillfully moderated the event.</description></item><item><title>OSAC OSM Web Development BootCamp 2023</title><link>https://osac.org.np/post/osac-osm-web-development-bootcamp-2023/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://osac.org.np/post/osac-osm-web-development-bootcamp-2023/</guid><description>An event must have interested participants to be called successful and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more proud to have more than 50 participants in our event &amp;ldquo;Web development bootcamp using Leaflet Library&amp;rdquo;.

Hence, we gladly announce the successful completion of 2-days event amongst the 3 days and hope to have the same numbers tomorrow on virtual session as well.</description></item></channel></rss>

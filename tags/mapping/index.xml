More than 40 students participated in this event. Most of the participants were new to OpenStreetMap. In this event, we learnt about OpenStreetMap and its use case in various areas, we also learnt how to do mapping and editing in OpenStreetMap. The quiz session at last added more fun in this learning process. Happy mapping to all the participants. We thank Miss Sushma Ghimire for mentoring throughout this session.</description></item></channel></rss>

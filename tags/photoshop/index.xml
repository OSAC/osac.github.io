This event marked the beginning of our initiative to host monthly 2-5 day bootcamps, workshops, or webinars on specific tech topics.
The bootcamp covered both theoretical aspects of designing and practical applications. Our talented speaker, Nikki Arts (@nikki_arts__), led an engaging hands-on session, while Anupama Rai (@anupamaa_raii) skillfully moderated the event.</description></item></channel></rss>
